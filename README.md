# The Calorie Tracker
This is a simple website used to find out about new meals based on your caloric intakes. In the website, you can enter what you have eaten and the code will find out how many calories there are in it using the CalorieNinjas API (please note that it automatically assumes that you have eaten 100g of it). Then, when you click on "Generate new meal", it will use the spoonacular API to find out new meals around the number of calories in your previous meals

## Note: This website is **not intended to give medical advice on what to eat**. It is just a simple project I tried to work on.
